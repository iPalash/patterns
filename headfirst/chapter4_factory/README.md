### Principles
- Depend on abstractions, do not depend on concrete classes
### Factory Method Pattern
- Define an interface for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate 
- Lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses
### Abstract Factory Pattern
- Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependents objects without specifying their concrete classes
